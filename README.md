# MealMate
MealMate is not just another recipe browsing app. It intricately fetches and presents meals from TheMealDB API, focusing on the Dessert category but with a twist. Beyond just listing meals alphabetically, MealMate employs advanced algorithms to curate recipes based on user preferences, seasonal ingredients, and nutritional information. The app provides a deep dive into each meal, including a comprehensive breakdown of ingredients, measurements, and cooking instructions, all while ensuring a clean and engaging UI. Special attention was given to filtering out null or empty values, ensuring the data presented is as accurate and useful as possible. MealMate represents a blend of technical prowess and a keen understanding of user needs, making it a standout project in my portfolio.
